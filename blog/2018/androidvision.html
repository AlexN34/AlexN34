    <h2>SpringBoot</h2>
<p>Last weekend I spent a lot of time re-familiarising with Java - I've spent a lot of time in the Python space recently. </p>
<p>I learned how to use <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">SpringBoot</a> for a take-home which required exposing an API on a Server connected to a MySQL backend and essentially writing a client to pretty print query results.</p>
<p>The general approach was similar to <code>Flask</code> in that there are provided annotations that route REST endpoints - you just need to route requests to the right functions and bob's your uncle. The package </p>
<p>JSON structure/type conversion was somewhat magical -- where with <code>requests</code> you parse data structures from strings/ints on raw JSON, using Springboot with <code>Jackson</code> in Java provides somewhat implicit conversion. Instead, you make a class that represents your JSON object (though I thankfully didn't need it, nesting works by having wrapper classes made too) and the library handles parsing to the input Object types you require. In my case, I needed dates called as a String to be parsed into a Date - it handled with no fuss which was convenient.</p>
<p>Still, I find myself preferring the ability to interact with objects in Python and the ability to simply <code>pip install</code> &amp; <code>import</code> stuff instead of fiddling with <code>maven</code> XML dependencies and plugins. I would say 50% of project time was dedicated to figuring out how to make my project <code>.jar</code> files run from commandline the way they do within the <code>IntelliJ</code> IDE!
That could be my fault for not knowing how to configure the IDE to output the right thing for me yet, but it was pretty frustrating.</p>
<h2>Android</h2>
<p>This Easter weekend I decided to scratch an itch that has been in my brain for some time - is there a library that provides streamed, locally processed text scanning for mobile app development? Essentially I wanted something in the vein of of a QR Code scanner library, without the need to take pictures to interact with the captured code. Also instead of a QR code, I wanted to manipulate arbitrary text (i.e. optical character recognition) I wanted it to work locally for performance reasons as well as offline functionality. </p>
<p>Knowing nothing about computer vision, I wanted to find a library to help out with this - rough searching brought up the <a href="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mobile-vision-ocr/">Google Vision APIs sample</a>. I spent the better part of a day (the tutorial takes 30min but I spent time investigating the API) to find it seems to deliver what I was looking for (particularly the local processing part).</p>
<p>I followed the introduction and slightly adapted the result to do further simple text parsing - at a glance it recognises printed text pretty well. I'm hoping to get the time to continue tinkering in the next couple months - I'm envisioning a conversion app I can use by hovering on the fly instead of repeatedly typing numbers into my phone's calculator. For anyone interested, the project currently lives <a href="https://github.com/AlexN34/ocrconverter">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Docker</h2>
<p>My docker (compose) file repo <a href="https://github.com/AlexN34/dockerfiles">here</a> has now amassed files for running JetBrains IDEs: IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm and AndroidStudio (this counts, it's based on IntelliJ)! </p>
<p>Each file took a lot longer than expected to set up because while they all use the same general structure for config storage, they're not <em>exactly</em> the same. I kept getting tripped up by the fact that the path looks like <code>~/{IDE Name}{version}/</code>; it changes with every resolution. I could probably make it general with symlinking something like <code>ln -s ~/.{IDE Name} {IDE Name}{version}</code>in the Dockerfile that builds the image in the first place and forever keeping a singular named repo for <code>.{IDE Name}</code>, but for now the files just code in the latest version number. </p>
<p>One cool thing was that it's possible to get USB passthrough to the docker container (for debugging on device) simply by mounting the <code>/dev/usb</code> folder (<em>everything</em> is a file) in Linux. Won't work on Windows though as apparently usb passthrough <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-for-windows-usb-support/38693/2">isn't yet supported</a> which dampens the dream of crossplatform for now.</p>
